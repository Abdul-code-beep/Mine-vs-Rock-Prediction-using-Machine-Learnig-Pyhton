Rock_Mine_Detection

Description:-
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a machine learning approach for predicting whether a given object is a rock or a mine using a dataset of submarine sonar images.
The project utilizes various machine learning techniques, including image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms,
to build an effective model for distinguishing between rocks and mines.

Key Features:-
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing sonar images for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Methods for extracting relevant features from images to enhance model performance.
Model Training: Implementation of various classification algorithms to build a robust prediction model.
Evaluation: Metrics and methods used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Dataset:-
The project uses the dataset Copy of sonar data.csv, which contains sonar readings with labeled instances indicating whether the object is a rock or a mine. 
The dataset includes features derived from sonar signals that are used for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

Technologies Used:-
->Python
->Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)

Installation:-
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed.
You can use pip to install them: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
